# My comment:
I am glad to see OpenEZX revived on GitHub.
I remember when OpenEZX was nowhere to find in 2019.
Looking back several products about montavista linux phones,
OpenEZX shut down the website, re-opened a website and put the archive on GitHub,
uClinux shut down the website and put the archive on Sourceforge,
EZXCodec was still on https://forum.motofan.ru/index.php?showtopic=125183
and so on.
I am the first people forking this repo, since A1200e was my first "smartphone" and I used it through my high school time,
now I am a programmer and finally have the ability to read some Linux kernel code or other code.
